            The year is 3069, and humanity has developed a large amount of technology. But everything changed when the aliens attacked. Not even the greatest hydrogen bombs put a dent in their army of thousands. It took a mere 420 days for the aliens to take over Earth and massacre humans in cities and towns. A small portion of humans retreated to an underground bunker and took along with them a few art pieces to reminisce on the past and keep their sacred cultures. The rest are left constantly running in circles to avoid detection on the surface. 0.1% of the human population survived, but every day, the number dwindles as some hiding on the surface are found. Aliens have moved into the planet and brought clear cylinders to place on the earth for faster travel. Day by day, humanity tries to find new weapons to use to take back their world just to fail in a hopeless, uphill battle.
